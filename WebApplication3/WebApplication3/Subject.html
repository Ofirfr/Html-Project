    <h2 style="font-family:Arial;"> why i chose this subject </h2>
    <div style="font-family:Arial;"> I chose "how I met your mother" because I watch this show atleast once a day and I am having a good time doing so.I like it because it is a humoristic show that includes real life situations, but not only the good and funny ones, but every big moment of ted and his friends life, it can be a marrige and happy moments or someone close dying and big breakups.This show is currently my favorite show and I'm just about to finish watching the show for the second time.</div>
